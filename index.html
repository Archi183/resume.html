      Hi, I'm Archisman Saha, a Junior Web Developer certified by Dr. Angela Yu.

    <h3>My story</h3>
    <p>
      I come from a medical background, a path chosen by my father after 10th
      grade. Despite my interest in computer science, I adjusted to the medical
      environment, inspired by my father's hard work. After 12th grade, I
      finally confessed my true passion to him, and he supported my decision
      wholeheartedly. Determined to be a self-learner, I delved into studying
      different programming languages and building projects. Through diligent
      effort, I've transitioned to a career in web development.
